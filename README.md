# TerribleHacksChromeExtension

Chrome extension made for Terrible Hacks 2015 that opens up a random link from a starting page, then a random link from that page, over and over until it finds a page whose html contains a given word or phrase. So it is pretty much the next google.

Uses JSON, Javascrip, and jQuery.
